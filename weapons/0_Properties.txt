The properties are:

- Primary Color;
- Damage;
- Range;
- Material (Wood - Bronze, Bone - Prata, Flint - Ouro, Obsidian - Diamante);
- Elements (Aid, Earth, Fire, Water) [these will only be shown in the game interface];

And that's the logic of Damage and Range to show the right weapons:

Sniper images = Range above 50% of it's Max value + Damage above 50% of it's Max value;

Shotgun images = Range below 50% of it's Max value + Damage above 50% of it's Max value;

AssaultRifle images = Range above 50% of it's Max value + Damage below 50% of it's Max value;

Sniper images = Range below 50% of it's Max value + Damage below 50% of it's Max value;
